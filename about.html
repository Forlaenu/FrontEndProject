                    <p>I've always loved computers and technology. As a kid I played games like Backyard Baseball and The Sims on the PC on the weekends and after doing homework.
                    I took a webpage design class in high school and really liked it, but I didn't know I could make a career out of it. After pursuing degrees in biology and nursing
                    and working in the healthcare field for a few years, I realized that it wasn't for me. Now I'm in a coding bootcamp and ready to pursue a career in tech! In my spare time
                    I like to watch football games and scary movies. I also like to spend quality time with my family, including my fiance and dog, Taco.

                <p>I've been a computer enthusiast since I was a kid. I grew up taking things apart, being curious how everything worked, and eventually building my own computers.
                I started programming in high school. I'll admit I was late to the party. I wanted to go to college for computer science or computer engineering, but that didn't pan out. I only touched programming a little bit since, but it's always been a dream. So here I am! I enjoy the challenges and know that I have a long road ahead of me to become the programmer I've always wanted to be. 
                Professionally, I've done almost everything but computer science and I'm ready for a change! I've been in the 12v Automotive industry for many years now, after having gone to a technical college for training. I've been an automotive detailer for some 13 years, and have touched custom upholstery and fabrication. 
                In my spare time, I tinker with small electronics, I work on my car(s), and spend time with my new family.</p>
